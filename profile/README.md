<h1 align="center">Hi!/Â¡Hola!/Hoi!/Salut! ðŸ‘‹, We are <a href="https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development">Dog Face Development Co.</a></h1>

We have been building open source programs, websites and other projects on Github since **April 25th, 2016**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 2.5 million commits**, opened **over 1 million issues**, submitted roughly **650k pull requests** across **4357 repositories**!

### Contributing to our projects!

We contribute to the tools we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining our own open source projects like:

- [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for GitHub
- [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) - A git extension for versioning large files
- [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The GitHub design system
